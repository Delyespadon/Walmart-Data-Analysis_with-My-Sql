# Walmart Data Analysis with my sql 

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize  MySQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. .

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
   - **Goal**: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

### 2. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
   - **Storage**: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.


### 3. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
  

### 4. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 5. Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 6. Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 7. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
    1)  **1. Analyze Customer Loyalty by Payment Method**
'''sql
SELECT 
    payment_method, customer_id, COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY payment_method , customer_id
ORDER BY transaction_count DESC;
'''
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
   - **Documentation**: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.

### 8. Project Publishing and Documentation
   - **Documentation**: Maintain well-structured documentation of the entire process in Markdown or a mySQL file
   - **Project Publishing**: Publish the completed project on GitHub or any other version control platform, including:
     - The `README.md` file (this document).
     - Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable).
     - SQL query scripts.
     - Data files (if possible) or steps to access them.

## Results and Insights

This section will include your analysis findings:
- **Sales Insights**: Key categories, branches with highest sales, and preferred payment methods.
- **Profitability**: Insights into the most profitable product categories and locations.
- **Customer Behavior**: Trends in ratings, payment preferences, and peak shopping hours.

## Future Enhancements

Possible extensions to this project:
- Integration with a dashboard tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) for interactive visualization.
- Additional data sources to enhance analysis depth.
- Automation of the data pipeline for real-time data ingestion and analysis.
